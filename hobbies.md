<br>There must be **something truly magical** about standing on stage to give [a fantastic speech], which considerably lifts my spirits and energizes my entire body. If you desire to master a specific knowledge in depth, just give a prelection. If you can explain to others for complete understanding, you are already an expert. I really enjoy the accomplishment of imparting my knowledge to others, so what I strive for is to be **a student's favorite lecturer** at the [best universities in my hometown].

<br>Swimming removes my worries, refreshes my body, and brings me courage to address any challenges. I extremely enjoy the feeling of being immersed in the water. Besides, I am a member of the Swimming Team at Fuzhou University, where I meet many sincere friends. I have reached **China National Second-level athlete Standard** in 50m breaststroke and won **Five Gold Medals** during my swimming career. Recently, I am also keen on surfing.


## Past Hobbies

I previously enjoyed making speaches(not meaning that I have give up this hobby), and fortunately before graduating from [ZZFLS](http://www.zzfls.com.cn/), I made a presnetation on 'Why we should learn foreign languages' in the[Opening ceremony of the Foreign Language Culture and Art Festival], running, swimming and playing badminton with my mates in junior high.
