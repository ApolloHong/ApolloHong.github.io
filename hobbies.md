<br>Fitness and bodybuilding removes my worries, refreshes my body, and brings me courage to address any challenges. And the pics above shows the condition of my 18 years old, cool right? Many people are so confused of why I love this  I extremely enjoy the feeling of being sweating in the gym and have a nutritious meal afterwards. Besides, I am the co-leader of 'Shanghai Jiao Tong University Calisthenics Association', where I meet many sincere friends, and recently I have founded [SPEIT-Fitness team](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/srSFn8PO7wmdxWodJL9YHg), come and join us.

I am a big fan of [Daft Punk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daft_Punk). As for movies, I have watched the movie [Into the Wild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_the_Wild_(film)) for more than 10 times, thowing me thoughts of what kind of life I am longing for. I also enjoy old nastalgia films like those of Giuseppe Tornatore, his films Space Trilogy, [Cinema Paradiso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_Paradiso), [Malèna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal%C3%A8na_(film)) and [The legend of 1900](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_1900) are my favorite.I also enjoy watching movies about bodybuilding, like [Pumping Iron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumping_Iron) and [Generation Iron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Iron).

## Past Hobbies

I previously enjoyed making speaches(not meaning that I have give up this hobby), and fortunately before graduating from [ZZFLS](http://www.zzfls.com.cn/), I made a presnetation on 'Why we should learn foreign languages' in the [Opening ceremony of the Foreign Language Culture and Art Festival], running, swimming and playing badminton with my mates in junior high.
