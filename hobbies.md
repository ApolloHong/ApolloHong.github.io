<br>Fitness and bodybuilding removes my worries, refreshes my body, and brings me courage to address any challenges. I extremely enjoy the feeling of being sweating in the gym and have a nutritious meal afterwards. Besides, I am the co-leader of 'Shanghai Jiao Tong University Calisthenics Association', where I meet many sincere friends, and recently I have founded [SPEIT-Fitness team](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/srSFn8PO7wmdxWodJL9YHg), come and join us.

## Past Hobbies

I previously enjoyed making speaches(not meaning that I have give up this hobby), and fortunately before graduating from [ZZFLS](http://www.zzfls.com.cn/), I made a presnetation on 'Why we should learn foreign languages' in the[Opening ceremony of the Foreign Language Culture and Art Festival], running, swimming and playing badminton with my mates in junior high.
