<br>Fitness and bodybuilding bring ease to my mind, rejuvenate my body, and empower me to face any challenge with courage. The pictures above showcase my progress at the age of 18 – pretty cool, right? Some may find it surprising why I am so passionate about this 'kinky' sport, but for me, it's an invigorating experience to sweat it out at the gym and indulge in a nutritious post-workout meal. This dedicated time in my 'lifespace' allows me to focus on myself, connecting with my body and mind.

Moreover, I am proud to be the co-leader of the 'Shanghai Jiao Tong University Calisthenics Association', where I have had the pleasure of meeting genuine friends who share the same interests. Recently, I have also founded the [SPEIT-Fitness](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/srSFn8PO7wmdxWodJL9YHg) team. Feel free to join us on this exciting journey!

<br>You can find my liked musics list via kugou app [ My kugou page](https://activity.kugou.com/share/v-c7b4da67/index.html?id=38b5db59c509bc9cb5d927f4951db677). I am a big fan of [Daft Punk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daft_Punk). As for movies, I have watched the movie [Into the Wild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_the_Wild_(film)) for more than 10 times, thowing me thoughts of what kind of life I am longing for. I also enjoy old nastalgia films like those of Giuseppe Tornatore, his films Space Trilogy, [Cinema Paradiso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_Paradiso), [Malèna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal%C3%A8na_(film)) and [The legend of 1900](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_1900) are my favorite.I also enjoy watching movies about bodybuilding, like [Pumping Iron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumping_Iron) and [Generation Iron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Iron).

## Past Hobbies
I previously enjoyed making speaches(not meaning that I have give up this hobby), and fortunately before graduating from [ZZFLS](http://www.zzfls.com.cn/), I made a presnetation on 'Why we should learn foreign languages' in the [Opening ceremony of the Foreign Language Culture and Art Festival], running, swimming and playing badminton with my mates in junior high.
