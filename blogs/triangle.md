## The Dilemmas of Life

<img src="https://apollohong.github.io/images/pic1.jpg">

Life is full of dilemmas, situations where we have to make difficult choices between three things that are all valuable but incompatible. In the gym, for example, we face the dilemma of reps, weight and control. We cannot lift heavy weights for many reps with perfect form. We have to compromise one of them to optimize the other two.

But the gym is not the only domain where we encounter dilemmas. In life, we also have to navigate art, love and career. These are three dimensions of human existence that can enrich us, satisfy us and give us purpose. But can we attain them all simultaneously?

Some people might affirm that it is feasible to pursue your artistic passion, find your soulmate and excel in your profession. They might cite examples of accomplished artists who have harmonious families and prosperous careers. They might contend that art, love and career are not antagonistic, but synergistic. They might say that you just need to work diligently, be adaptable and manage your time wisely.

But others might dissent. They might say that art, love and career are intrinsically conflicting, that they demand different skills, values and sacrifices. They might cite examples of tormented artists who have renounced their relationships and financial security for their craft. They might contend that art, love and career are not synergistic, but competitive. They might say that you have to choose one or two of them and relinquish the other.

So who is correct? Is there a way to have it all, or do we have to settle for less? I don’t have a conclusive answer to this question, but I would like to hear your opinions. What do you think about the dilemma of art, love and career? How do you navigate them in your life? Do you think it is worthwhile pursuing all three of them, or do you prioritize one or two of them? Please share your comments with me and let’s have a dialogue.
