> "I'm not meant to die in here. - Here, there. What's the difference?" — The Dark Knight Rises (2012)

This poignant line from The Dark Knight Rises is more than just a line to me; it's the anthem of my 2024 voyage. The question of here and there, of the familiar and the foreign, has been the compass guiding my steps. It propelled me to forsake the comforts of China for the scholarly pursuits of École Polytechnique in Paris, France. It's a chronicle of decisions, evolution, and the pursuit of the unexplored.
Escaping the Comfort Zone
In 2024, I made a life-altering choice—to leave the known behind and immerse myself in the rigorous academic environment of École Polytechnique in Paris. This decision was fueled by an unquenchable desire for knowledge, a deep-seated curiosity about different cultures, and a personal challenge to step beyond my boundaries. I was eager to navigate a new educational paradigm within a distinct cultural context, to broaden my perspectives, and to diversify my life's narrative.
The 'Firsts' of 2024
This year, I gathered a collection of "firsts," each a gem in the tiara of my experiences.
•	First Academic Summer Research: I ventured into the unexplored realms of academia, pushing my limits, and engaging in intellectual dialogues with scholars from around the world. This journey not only expanded my intellectual horizons but also sharpened my research acumen.
•	First Time Playing American Tackle Football in Hangzhou: On the playing fields of Hangzhou, I joined forces with my teammates, experiencing the fervor and camaraderie inherent in this sport. Each dash and collision were a trial of my personal fortitude.
•	First Wild Halloween with French Profs and Friends: In a land far from home, I partook in this enigmatic and exuberant celebration with newfound companions. We donned an array of costumes, immersing ourselves in the revelry of the night. It was a cultural exchange and a liberation of the spirit.
Envisioning 2025
As 2024 fades into memory, I am brimming with anticipation for the year to come. In 2025, I aspire to continue scaling academic heights and seek a more harmonious blend of personal and professional fulfillment. I am eager for the new challenges, adventures, and "firsts" that await.
