# About Me

<img src="https://apollohong.github.io/images/LizhanHongcasual.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

**Hello, I am Lizhan Hong (Apollo, [洪历展](https://apollohong.github.io/file/Resume-LizhanHong.pdf)).**

I am currently an **Engineering Student (M.Sc. Level)** in **Applied Mathematics** at [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en) (Paris, France), and a **B.S. candidate** in **Computer Science & French** at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/).

My academic journey is a blend of rigorous mathematical theory and practical engineering application. I am passionate about bridging the gap between theoretical models and real-world financial or industrial systems.

**[News] I am actively seeking a Summer Internship (June–September 2026) in Quantitative Finance or Data Science.**

Here is [my Resume in Chinese](https://apollohong.github.io/file/洪历展中文简历.pdf), [in English](https://apollohong.github.io/file/Resume-LizhanHong.pdf), and [in French](https://apollohong.github.io/file/Lizhan_Hong_CV__French_.pdf).

## Research Interests

My research focuses on **Quantitative Finance**, **Machine Learning**, and **Digital Twins**. I am particularly interested in:

- **Schrödinger Bridge Diffusion Models** & Markovian properties.
- **Quantitative Trading Strategies** (Multi-factor models, LSTM, Covariance shrinkage).
- **AI for Science** (Nuclear Reactor Digital Twins, Metaheuristic algorithms).

## Selected Experience & Projects

### 1. Quantitative Research & Financial Modeling
**École Polytechnique | Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance**
*   **Schrödinger Bridges:** Conducted theoretical research on discrete Schrödinger bridges and implemented Sinkhorn and IPF algorithms for financial time series simulations.
*   **Multi-Factor Strategy:** Developed equities strategies utilizing MACD, Ledoit-Wolf covariance shrinkage, and LSTM.
    *   *Performance:* Achieved a **Sharpe ratio of 5.0**, >100% 3-year return, and kept max drawdown within 10% on CSI 300.
    *   Implemented strict turnover control (0.1% commission) and regularization to ensure stable out-of-sample performance.

### 2. Digital Twin & AI for Engineering (Past Program)
**AISEA Laboratory | SJTU Incubator**

As a Project Leader and Research Assistant, I led the development of operational digital-twin platforms.
*   **Algorithms:** Designed a novel hybrid **KNNLHS algorithm** (latency <0.1s) and utilized **SVD-Autoencoder** for Model Order Reduction.
*   **Application:** Developed a modular Reactor Operation Digital Twin using metaheuristic algorithms (Fast Simulated Annealing, Cuckoo Search).

**Concept Demo (Sheng Xuanhuai Innovation Contest Silver Award):**
