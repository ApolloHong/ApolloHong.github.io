# About Me

<img src="https://apollohong.github.io/images/LizhanHongsuite.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

**Hello, I am Lizhan Hong (Apollo, [洪历展](https://apollohong.github.io/file/Resume-LizhanHong.pdf)).**

I am currently an **Engineering Student (M.Sc. Level)** in **Applied Mathematics** at [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en) (Paris, France), and a **B.S. candidate** in **Computer Science & French** at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/).

My academic journey is a blend of rigorous mathematical theory and practical engineering application. I am passionate about bridging the gap between theoretical models and real-world financial or industrial systems.

**[News] I am actively seeking a Summer Internship (June–September 2026) in Quantitative Finance or Data Science.**

Here is [my Resume in Chinese](https://apollohong.github.io/file/洪历展中文简历.pdf), [in English](https://apollohong.github.io/file/Resume-LizhanHong.pdf), and [in French](https://apollohong.github.io/file/Lizhan_Hong_CV__French_.pdf).

## Research Interests

My research focuses on **Quantitative Finance**, **Machine Learning**, and **Digital Twins**. I am particularly interested in:

- **Schrödinger Bridge Diffusion Models** & Markovian properties.
- **Quantitative Trading Strategies** (Multi-factor models, LSTM, Covariance shrinkage).
- **AI for Science** (Nuclear Reactor Digital Twins, Metaheuristic algorithms).

## Selected Experience & Projects

### 1. Quantitative Trading Strategy (Alpha Generation)
**Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance (SAIF)**

I developed and backtested robust multi-factor equity strategies targeting the CSI 300 universe.
*   **Methodology:** Integrated traditional financial indicators (MACD) with advanced Machine Learning models (**LSTM**) and statistical techniques (**Ledoit-Wolf covariance shrinkage**).
*   **Performance:**
    *   Achieved a **Sharpe Ratio of 5.0** and **>100% 3-year return**.
    *   Controlled Max Drawdown within **10%** (CSI 300 daily).
*   **Risk Control:** Mitigated overfitting and ensured stable out-of-sample performance using L1/L2 regularization and strict turnover control (considering 0.1% commission).

### 2. Generative Financial Modeling (Stochastic Processes)
**École Polytechnique**

This project focuses on the theoretical derivation and simulation of **Schrödinger Bridge Diffusion Models** for financial time series.
*   **Theory:** Conducted research on the derivation and Markovian properties of discrete Schrödinger bridges.
*   **Implementation:** Implemented **Sinkhorn Algorithm**, **Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF)**, and Schrödinger Bridges Diffusion.
*   **Application:** Applied these models for high-fidelity financial time series simulations and risk management scenarios.

### 3. Digital Twin & AI for Engineering (Past Program)
**AISEA Laboratory | SJTU Incubator**

As a Project Leader and Research Assistant, I led the development of operational digital-twin platforms.
*   **Algorithms:** Designed a novel hybrid **KNNLHS algorithm** (latency <0.1s) and utilized **SVD-Autoencoder** for Model Order Reduction.
*   **Application:** Developed a modular Reactor Operation Digital Twin using metaheuristic algorithms (Fast Simulated Annealing, Cuckoo Search).
